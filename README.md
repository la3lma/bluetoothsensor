# bluetoothsensor
Listen for presence of bluetooth and wifi devices, report back to the mothership.

TODO:
* Verify that new hw works
* Order new battery powered hw (also see if it's possible to repair current).
* Make server that announces its presence on ddns.
* Find server dynamically using ddns.
* Make reports as complete as possible.
* Make docker or kubernetes-powered logger, logging to some searchable database
* Set up notebook access to that db.
* Get some enclosures, mass produce (meaning five):-)
